		Hi,

		Thank you for visiting my ePortfolio profile page. My name is <i>Willie Munoz</i>, born and raised in Washington Heights. My parents were born in the Dominican Republic. I am a young Hispanic fellow making my way into the "Technology World". Below, you may read more and get to know me better. Don't be shy and feel free to  contact me for anything, literally ANYTHING!

		<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Welcome, my name is Willie Munoz. I am a twenty-six years old currently pursuing an Associate of Science in LaGuardia Community College. I am an extremely technology enthusiastic and highly motivated person. As I attend college full time, I am keeping up with the technology field by networking with future driven peers and attend STEM events where learn more about the future of technology. In my spare time, I enjoy helping friends, family, and colleagues with any of their personal technological issues including repairing their computers or helping them with a PowerPoint presentation. Also, by having the opportunity of an empty room in my apartment I was able to build an office space in which I call “The Lab”. In The Lab is where I get my homework done, consistently perform all types of research and testing, as well as operating a small T-Shirt business for which  I publish a website for, customize garments, and make fashionable ideas come to life.</span>

		Growing up in Washington Heights, schools were always close to home. On the other hand, after relocating several times, High School and the multiple Colleges I attended to were all miles away. The commute was never so great besides admiring the New York lifestyle and being able to see new faces every day. Taking part of all these tremendously versatile schools would always be a part of me for the rest of my life. I continued to grow as a person by experiencing some rough times as well as enjoying wonderful moments with friends, family, and colleagues. My peers, teachers, counselors, and principals were all major influences to my life and education during and after school.
